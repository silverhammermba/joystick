This is a Ruby extension that wraps the fuctionality provided by
linux/joystick.h, allowing Ruby scripts to use input from Xbox 360
controllers, PS3 Sixaxis controllers, etc.

I originally took this code from Claudio Fiorini's rjoystick gem, made it a
little easier to use, made it work with Ruby's Threads, and added
documentation.

You can find the gem version at https://rubygems.org/gems/joystick
